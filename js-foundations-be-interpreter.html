// Problem 1
//console.log(first_variable);//log undefined, removed it
var first_variable = "Yipee I was first!";
function firstFunc() {
  first_variable = "Not anymore!!!";
  console.log(first_variable)//log locally "Not anymore!!"
}
console.log(first_variable);//should log Yipee...


// Problem 2
var food = "Chicken";
function eat() {
  food = "half-chicken";
  console.log(food);//log locally "half-checken"
  var food = "gone"; 
}
eat();//correction: it should log "half-chicken" because var food="gone" only got stored locally, never got returned
console.log(food);//correction: it should log "Chicken" because anything happens on eat() will only impact when eat() get executed

// Problem 3
var new1 = "NEW!";
function lastFunc() {
  new1 = "old";
  return new1;
}
console.log(lastFunc());//correction: it returns error because new1 is reserved keyword, replace all new to newStuff
